# Rental-Akun Revamp â€” Preview & Deploy

Open `index.html` in your browser to preview locally.

To deploy, upload the folder to GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel (static hosting).

IMPORTANT: In `assets/js/main.js` replace `adminPhone` with your admin WhatsApp number in international format (no plus signs or dashes). Example: `15551234567`.

Privacy note: The app deliberately masks passwords in the prefilled WhatsApp message. Do NOT include full passwords in the prefilled message; send them privately to admin if asked.
